# Advent of Code 2020

## Event

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) is an annual event where developers get the chance to solve puzzles which are suited for computers. The site itself does a much better job of describing it.

Each day is in its own folder, with a separate file or module for each part available.

## Language

This year, I am using [Wren](https://wren.io/) because I haven't used the language much yet, and I don't want to use a different language every day again. It is a lightweight scripting language which is great for embedding in other applications and built with concurrency in mind. It's been fun so far, as of day 1.
